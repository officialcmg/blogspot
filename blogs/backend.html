                <h1>The Beginner’s Guide to Backend Development (2024 Guide)</h1>
                <h2>What Is Back End Development?</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, backend web development is what keeps the internet running behind the scenes.</p>
            
                <p>Backend developers are primarily focused on how a website or app works. A back end web developer writes code that focuses on the functionality and logic powering the application they’re working on, and the technology they work on is never directly seen by users.</p>
            
                <p>Backend technologies are a combination of servers, applications, and databases.</p>

                <h2>So what job does a back-end developer perform?</h2>
            
                <p>Responsibilities of backend programmers could involve writing APIs, writing code to interact with a database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and other kinds of backend work.</p>
            
                <p>The exact duties of a back end web developer often depend on the specific role and company.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Front-end Vs Backend Programming</strong><br>Intuitively, the other side of backend development is the front end.</p>
            
                <p>The key difference is that while backend developers build how a website or application functions, front-end programmers build and design the interface, determining how the site or program looks to users.</p>
            
                <p>Backend web development lays the foundational code that enables websites to process the actions that users take on the front end and deliver the correct information in return.</p>
            
                <h2>Backend developers typically earn higher salaries than front-end developers, as backend development languages tend to be more technical. The average salary for a backend developer is $158,984, while front-end developers earn $112,083.</h2>
            
                <p>There are also full-stack developers, who can work with both front-end and backend tools and technologies. They’re the jack-of-all-trades of the programming world.</p>
            
                <p>➡️ Learn more about what is involved in front-end development in this post.</p>
            
                <p><strong>What Does a Backend Developer Do?</strong><br>So what does a backend developer actually do in a typical workday?</p>
            
                <p>According to backend developer Ali Bayat from his blog article The Day in the Life of a Backend Developer, “Reflecting on a typical working day, I would say I spend 50% of my time on project work, 20% in meetings and on general communication, and the remaining 30% working on immediate requests and bugs.”</p>
            
                <p>So, as a back end web developer, you might spend your day doing backend work things like:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintaining legacy applications (older applications that have already been built by other programmers)</li>
                    <li>Putting out fires (e.g., bugs, broken applications)</li>
                    <li>Attending meetings (to gather requirements for a project)</li>
                    <li>Collaborating with front end devs (on a project, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Actually writing code for new applications/projects</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>So, while you will certainly be coding with backend programming languages, do not picture that as being the only thing you will do as a backend web developer.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Types of Backend Development Languages</strong><br>Backend programming can either be object-oriented (OOP) or functional.</p>
            
                <p>OOP is the technique that focuses on the creation of objects. With object-oriented programming, statements should be executed in a particular order. Popular OOP languages are Java, .NET, and Python,</p>
            
                <p>Functional back end programming is a technique that is more “action”-based. Functional programming uses declarative language, which means that statements can be executed in any order. It is commonly used for data science, and popular languages are SQL, F#, and R.</p>
            
                <p>Back-end development languages can either be statically typed or dynamically typed. The former is more rigid, but better at catching errors, whereas the latter is more flexible but allows for variables to change types (which could account for unexpected errors). This article by Hacker Noon goes into greater detail if you are interested in finding out more.</p>
